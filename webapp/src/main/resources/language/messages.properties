index.content=<h2> Let's Bend - Learn to play the harmonica and bend like a pro </h2> <p> For beginners, <em>bending</em> notes on a harmonica is a big hurdle. It requires a lot of time through regular practice. By bending, even the semitones can be sounded on the harmonica through special drawing and blowing techniques, which cannot be reached by regular playing of the channels. Beginners ask themselves, "Is that bending now or is the semitone exactly hit?" </p> <p> The lean and performant <em>Lets' Bend</em> app makes it easy and fun for anyone to master the art of bending. By visualising the notes you play, you'll be bending like a pro in no time. </p> <p> A short video about the functionality is published on YouTube:</p> <div class="video-container"> <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="video" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VNuPTUcXYV4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" width="560"></iframe> </div> \
<p> The original idea in developing the <em>Let's Bend</em> app was to create an application that is available on all common operating systems and whose application window scales well. It is not uncommon to have other applications open while practising or to want to use the programme on different devices. Last but not least, all keys and the most common special tunings of harmonicas should be supported.</p> \ \
<p> As a result, there are now two versions of the app. A desktop version for the operating systems macOS, Debian and Windows, and an Android version for mobile devices.</p> <p> The Android version is published free of charge and without advertising on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp&hl=en">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Christian-Kierdorf-Lets-Bend/dp/B0C96X2KRG">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp/">F-Droid</a>.</p> <p> Since a publication on Microsoft Store and Apple App Store is associated with additional development costs that exceed the financial effort of a hobby development project, the desktop version was not published there. Instead, <a href="/download.html">here is an alternative download option for the desktop version.</a> </p> \
<p> As a preview, there is a <a href="/letsbend.html">web version</a> available here.</p> <p>For detailed instructions, check out our <a href="/doc.html">User Guide</a>.</p> \
<p> The source code of the applications is published <a href="https://github.com/egdels/bluesharpbendingapp">here.</a> </p><p> If you would like to support the developer of <em>Let's Bend</em> by making a voluntary donation, there is a <em>Buy me a coffee</em> function in the desktop version. But even here, <em>Let's Bend</em> remains free of charge. </p> <p> But enough talk now. <em>Let's Bend!</em></p>
doc.content=<h2>User Guide</h2> \
<h3>Android Version</h3> \
<h4>Main Harmonica View</h4> \
<p>The main view of the Android app displays a harmonica with its holes and notes. When you play a note on your harmonica, the app will highlight the corresponding note on the screen.</p> \
<p><img src="/images/docs/android_harp_view.jpg" alt="Android Harmonica View" class="screenshot" /></p> \
<p>Example: When you play the C note on hole 4 (blow), the app will highlight this note. If you try to bend the note, the app will show you how close you are to hitting the target note with a colored indicator.</p> \
<h4>Enlarged Note View</h4> \
<p>When you play a note and click on it, you can see an enlarged view of that note at the top of the screen. This enlarged view provides more detailed feedback about your playing.</p> \
<p>The enlarged view shows:</p> \
<ul> \
  <li><strong>Note name:</strong> Displayed in large, bold text for easy reading.</li> \
  <li><strong>Cents value:</strong> Shows how far your pitch is from the target note (measured in cents, where 100 cents equals one semitone).</li> \
  <li><strong>Visual indicator:</strong> A horizontal line that moves up or down based on your pitch. When the line is in the middle, you're hitting the note perfectly. If the line moves up, you're playing sharp; if it moves down, you're playing flat.</li> \
  <li><strong>Color feedback:</strong> The line changes color from green (when you're close to the target pitch) to red (when you're far from the target pitch).</li> \
</ul> \
<p>This enlarged view is particularly helpful when practicing bending techniques, as it gives you immediate visual feedback on how accurately you're hitting the target notes.</p> \
<h4>Training View</h4> \
<p>The training view helps you practice specific notes or scales. You can select different training types and precision levels.</p> \
<p><img src="/images/docs/android_training_view.jpg" alt="Android Training View" class="screenshot" /></p> \
<p>Example: Select "Bending Training" from the training types and set the precision to "Medium". The app will guide you through a series of notes to practice, showing your progress as you go.</p> \
<h4>Precision Setting</h4> \
<p>The precision setting determines how accurately you need to hit a note before the app advances to the next note in training. The setting is measured in "cents" (a musical unit where 100 cents equals one semitone).</p> \
<ul> \
  <li><strong>Low values (5-15):</strong> Require high accuracy. You must play very close to the target note.</li> \
  <li><strong>Medium values (20-30):</strong> Provide a balanced challenge for most players.</li> \
  <li><strong>High values (35-45):</strong> Are more forgiving and ideal for beginners or when practicing difficult techniques.</li> \
</ul> \
<p>Tip: Start with a higher value if you're new, and gradually reduce it to improve your accuracy.</p> \
<h4>Settings</h4> \
<p>In the settings view, you can configure the app according to your preferences.</p> \
<p><img src="/images/docs/android_settings_view.jpg" alt="Android Settings View" class="screenshot" /></p> \
<p>Example: To change the harmonica key, select "C" from the key dropdown. To change the tuning, select "Richter" from the tuning dropdown.</p> \
<h4>Understanding Key and Tuning</h4> \
<p>The key and tuning settings are important for the app to correctly recognize your harmonica:</p> \
<ul> \
  <li><strong>Key:</strong> The key indicates the fundamental tone your harmonica is tuned to. Most beginners start with a C harmonica, but harmonicas come in various keys like A, Bb, D, F, G, etc. The key is usually printed on the harmonica. Selecting the correct key ensures the app displays the right notes as you play.</li> \
  <li><strong>Tuning:</strong> The tuning determines how the individual holes of your harmonica are arranged. The most common tuning is "Richter," which is used in most blues harmonicas. However, there are other tunings like "Solo," "Paddy Richter," or "Melody Maker" that are optimized for specific music styles. The correct tuning setting ensures the app displays the notes accurately on the screen.</li> \
</ul> \
<p>Tip: If you're unsure about your harmonica's key or tuning, check the packaging or the imprint on the harmonica. Most blues harmonicas use Richter tuning, and the key (e.g., "C", "A", "G") is typically clearly marked.</p> \
<h4>Confidence Setting</h4> \
<p>The confidence setting determines how certain the app needs to be before it identifies a note you're playing. It affects the pitch detection algorithm's behavior:</p> \
<ul> \
  <li><strong>Higher values (0.8-0.95):</strong> Require more certainty before identifying a note. This results in more accurate pitch detection but may be less responsive.</li> \
  <li><strong>Medium values (0.5-0.75):</strong> Provide a balance between accuracy and responsiveness for most players.</li> \
  <li><strong>Lower values (0.05-0.45):</strong> Accept less certain results, making the app more responsive but potentially less accurate in noisy environments.</li> \
</ul> \
<p>Tip: If you're playing in a quiet environment and want precise feedback, use higher values. If you're in a noisier setting or want faster response times, try lower values.</p> \
<h3>Desktop Version</h3> \
<h4>Main Harmonica View</h4> \
<p>The desktop version provides a larger view of the harmonica, making it easier to see the notes and bending indicators.</p> \
<p><img src="/images/docs/desktop_harp_view.jpg" alt="Desktop Harmonica View" class="screenshot" /></p> \
<p>Example: The desktop version allows you to resize the window to fit your screen, making it convenient to use alongside other applications while practicing.</p> \
<h4>Enlarged Note View</h4> \
<p>Similar to the Android version, when you play a note and click on it, you can see an enlarged view of that note in the center of the screen. This enlarged view provides more detailed feedback about your playing and works the same way as in the Android version. Click anywhere on the enlarged view to close it.</p> \
<h4>Training View</h4> \
<p>The desktop training view offers the same functionality as the Android version but with a layout optimized for larger screens.</p> \
<p><img src="/images/docs/desktop_training_view.jpg" alt="Desktop Training View" class="screenshot" /></p> \
<p>Example: The desktop version may include additional training options or visualization features not available in the Android version.</p> \
<h3>Web Version</h3> \
<p>The web version allows you to practice directly in your browser without installing any software.</p> \
<p><img src="/images/docs/web_app_view.jpg" alt="Web App View" class="screenshot" /></p> \
<p>Example: To use the web version, select your harmonica key and tuning, then click the "Start" button to begin. Allow microphone access when prompted by your browser.</p> \
<h3>Pitch Detection Algorithms</h3> \
<p>Let's Bend uses advanced pitch detection algorithms to accurately identify the notes you play. You can choose between two algorithms in the settings:</p> \
<h4>YIN Algorithm</h4> \
<p>The YIN algorithm is a well-established method for pitch detection that works by analyzing the autocorrelation of the audio signal.</p> \
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p> \
<ul> \
  <li>Reliable and stable pitch detection</li> \
  <li>Good for beginners as it's less sensitive to playing technique variations</li> \
  <li>Works well across different harmonica types</li> \
</ul> \
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p> \
<ul> \
  <li>Slower processing (average 297ms)</li> \
  <li>Slightly less accurate (average 0.97 cents deviation)</li> \
  <li>May consume more battery on mobile devices</li> \
</ul> \
<h4>MPM Algorithm (McLeod Pitch Method)</h4> \
<p>The MPM algorithm is a more modern approach that uses the normalized square difference function to detect pitch.</p> \
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p> \
<ul> \
  <li>Much faster processing (average 7.59ms, about 39 times faster than YIN)</li> \
  <li>Higher accuracy (average 0.03 cents deviation)</li> \
  <li>More battery-efficient on mobile devices</li> \
</ul> \
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p> \
<ul> \
  <li>May be more sensitive to playing technique variations</li> \
  <li>Can sometimes produce less stable results with certain harmonica types</li> \
</ul> \
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Start with the YIN algorithm if you're a beginner. As you become more confident with your playing technique, try switching to MPM for faster response and higher accuracy.</p> \
<h3>Tips for Beginners</h3> \
<ul> \
  <li>Start with single notes: Focus on playing clean single notes before attempting to bend.</li> \
  <li>Use the visual feedback: Watch the app's indicators to see how close you are to the target note.</li> \
  <li>Practice regularly: Bending takes time to master, so practice a little bit every day.</li> \
  <li>Try different mouth positions: Experiment with tongue position and mouth shape to find what works for you.</li> \
  <li>Use the training mode: The structured exercises in training mode can help you progress faster.</li> \
</ul>
