index.content=<h2> Let's Bend - Learn to play the harmonica and bend like a pro </h2> <p> For beginners, <em>bending</em> notes on a harmonica is a big hurdle. It requires a lot of time through regular practice. By bending, even the semitones can be sounded on the harmonica through special drawing and blowing techniques, which cannot be reached by regular playing of the channels. Beginners ask themselves, "Is that bending now or is the semitone exactly hit?" </p> <p> The lean and performant <em>Lets' Bend</em> app makes it easy and fun for anyone to master the art of bending. By visualising the notes you play, you'll be bending like a pro in no time. </p> <p> A short video about the functionality is published on YouTube:</p> <div class="video-container"> <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="video" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VNuPTUcXYV4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" width="560"></iframe> </div> <p> The original idea in developing the <em>Let's Bend</em> app was to create an application that is available on all common operating systems and whose application window scales well. It is not uncommon to have other applications open while practising or to want to use the programme on different devices. Last but not least, all keys and the most common special tunings of harmonicas should be supported.</p> <p> As a result, there are now two versions of the app. A desktop version for the operating systems macOS, Debian and Windows, and an Android version for mobile devices.</p> <p> The Android version is published free of charge and without advertising on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp&hl=en">Google Play</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Christian-Kierdorf-Lets-Bend/dp/B0C96X2KRG">Amazon.</a></p> <p> Since a publication on Microsoft Store and Apple App Store is associated with additional development costs that exceed the financial effort of a hobby development project, the desktop version was not published there. Instead, <a href="/download.html">here is an alternative download option for the desktop version.</a> </p><p> The source code of the applications is published <a href="https://github.com/egdels/bluesharpbendingapp">here.</a> </p><p> If you would like to support the developer of <em>Let's Bend</em> by making a voluntary donation, there is a <em>Buy me a coffee</em> function in the desktop version. But even here, <em>Let's Bend</em> remains free of charge. </p> <p> But enough talk now. <em>Let's Bend!</em></p>

android.PrivacyPolicy=<h2> Privacy Policy Android-App</h2> <p> This is the privacy policy for the Android version of <em>Let's Bend</em>, the BluesHarpBendingApp, published on the Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore. The aim of this application is to assist harmonica players in accurately hitting notes. </p> <p> <em>Let's Bend</em> was developed as a hobby project by: </p> <address> Christian Kierdorf<br/> Gringsstrasse 25<br/> 53177 Bonn<br/> Deutschland<br/> </address> <p> If you have any questions about this statement, you can email the developer: <span class="rtl">ed.bewilhcs@frodreik.naitsirhc</span> </p> <p> The application is ad-free and freely available for use without requiring individual registration. To utilize the application, access to the microphone of the device on which it is installed is necessary. It is possible that during usage of the application, in addition to harmonica sounds, personal data may be collected in the form of audio. These audio data are treated by the application in the same manner as harmonica sounds and are not separately analyzed. </p> <p> Sounds are captured as a continuous data stream using the standard <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder">MediaRecorder</a> library, converted into musical notes using mathematical methods, and displayed for visualization. The data stream is neither permanently stored as a file on the device nor transmitted to third parties for further processing. The data remains solely on the device for the duration required to convert the data stream into musical notes. </p> <p> You can revoke the microphone permission at any time through the device's system settings. </p> <p> Apart from sounds, the application does not process any other personal data. </p> <p> By installing and using <em>Let's Bend</em> via Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore, additional personal data may be collected, and the processing of such data is beyond the developer's control. Therefore, please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Google Play Store's</a> and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/policy-center/privacy-security.html">Amazon Appstore's</a> privacy policy for more information. </p> <p> This declaration was created on June 9, 2023, and is published <a href="https://www.letsbend.de/datenschutz.html#privacy_policy_android">here.</a> German version is available <a href="https://www.letsbend.de/datenschutz.html#datenschutz_android">here</a>. </p>
