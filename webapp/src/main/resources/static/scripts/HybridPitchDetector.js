/**
 * The HybridPitchDetector class provides a robust, hybrid approach for pitch detection by
 * combining multiple algorithms and techniques to achieve high accuracy across a wide
 * frequency range. It incorporates noise detection, energy analysis, and pitch estimation
 * tailored to different frequency bands.
 *
 * This class leverages the YIN, MPM, and Fourier Transform algorithms to effectively handle
 * pitch detection for low, mid, and high-frequency ranges, respectively. By analyzing the
 * energy distribution and characteristics of the input audio signal, it dynamically applies
 * the most appropriate algorithm for pitch detection.
 *
 * This detector is designed for applications in music analysis, speech processing, and other
 * domains requiring precise pitch estimation.
