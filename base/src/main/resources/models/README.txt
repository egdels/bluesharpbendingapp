This directory should contain the TensorFlow Magenta model for chord detection.

The actual model file should be named 'magenta_chord_detection_model.pb' and placed in this directory.

You can obtain a pre-trained model from the Magenta project (https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) 
or train your own model using the Magenta framework.

For development and testing purposes, you can use a placeholder model that returns
simulated chord detection results.
