/**
 * Test class for the HybridPitchDetector.
 * <p>
 * This class tests the HybridPitchDetector which combines the strengths of YIN, MPM, and FFT algorithms
 * to achieve accurate pitch detection across a wide frequency range. The HybridPitchDetector uses:
 * - YIN algorithm for low frequencies (below 300Hz) - better accuracy for low frequencies
 * - MPM algorithm for medium frequencies (300Hz to 1000Hz) - good balance of accuracy and performance
 * - FFT algorithm for high frequencies (above 1000Hz) - better performance for high frequencies
 * <p>
 * The tests verify that:
 * 1. Low frequencies are correctly detected using YIN
 * 2. Medium frequencies are correctly detected using MPM
 * 3. High frequencies are correctly detected using FFT
 * 4. Frequencies around the thresholds (300Hz and 1000Hz) are handled correctly
 * 5. Edge cases like silence and noise are handled properly
 * 6. The algorithm can correctly combine results from multiple detectors
 * 7. The algorithm is robust to noise and different signal types
 * <p>
 * Additionally, this class includes test cases adapted from YINPitchDetectorTest and MPMPitchDetectorTest
 * to ensure compatibility with those algorithms.
 * <p>
 * This test class uses utility methods from {@link AudioTestUtils} to generate test signals.
