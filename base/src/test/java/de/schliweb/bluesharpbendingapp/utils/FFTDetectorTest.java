 * The tests verify that:
 * 1. The algorithm correctly detects pitches at and above 1000 Hz
 * 2. It handles mixed frequencies and harmonics appropriately at higher frequencies
 * 3. It is robust to noise at higher frequencies
 * 4. It can detect rapid frequency changes in the higher frequency range

     * Tests the FFT algorithm's ability to handle subharmonics in various scenarios.

     * This test verifies that the FFT algorithm correctly handles subharmonics, which are
     * frequency components at fractions of the fundamental frequency (e.g., f/2, f/3, f/4).
     * Subharmonics are important in harmonica playing, especially when analyzing bending
     * techniques and complex tones.
     * <p>
     * The test covers:
     * 1. Different subharmonic ratios (1/2, 1/3, 1/4)
     * 2. Different amplitude ratios between fundamental and subharmonic
     * 3. Cases where the subharmonic is stronger than the fundamental
     * 4. Complex signals with multiple subharmonics
