# Utility Classes Test Coverage

This directory contains tests for the utility classes in the `de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp.utils` package.

## Test Coverage

### LoggingContext

The `LoggingContextTest` class provides comprehensive test coverage for the `LoggingContext` utility class, including:

- Basic MDC operations (put, get, remove, clear)
- Context management with Runnable and Supplier
- Map-based context operations
- Request ID generation and management
- Component, operation, user ID, and session ID operations
- Exception handling in context operations

### LoggingUtils

The `LoggingUtilsTest` class provides comprehensive test coverage for the `LoggingUtils` utility class, including:

- Application lifecycle logging (startup, shutdown)
- Component initialization logging
- User action logging
- Operation logging (start, completion)
- Audio processing logging
- Debug logging
- Warning logging
- Error logging (with and without exceptions)
- Fatal error logging
- Configuration change logging
- Performance logging

## Testing Approach

### LoggingContext

The `LoggingContextTest` uses Mockito's `MockedStatic` to mock the static `MDC` class from SLF4J. This allows the tests to verify that the correct methods are called on the MDC class without actually modifying the real MDC context.

### LoggingUtils

The `LoggingUtilsTest` uses a different approach. Since the `LoggingUtils` class uses a static logger field, the tests use the `setLogger` method to inject a mock logger. This allows the tests to verify that the correct logging methods are called with the expected parameters.

## Recent Improvements

1. Fixed the `LoggingUtilsTest` to use the `setLogger` method instead of trying to use reflection to modify the final static logger field. This resolves the `IllegalAccessException` that was occurring when trying to set a final field.

2. Modified the `LoggingUtils` class to:
   - Replace the `@Slf4j` annotation with an explicit logger field
   - Make the logger field non-final so it can be modified for testing
   - Add a `setLogger` method to allow tests to inject a mock logger

These changes make the utility classes more testable while maintaining their functionality in the application.
